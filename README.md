# My Fritzing Parts
These are parts I created for my Fritzing projects.  Some of the part's schematics are not accurate (the pins & PCB are correct).  I'm still 
learning Inkscape so when I learn how to draw circuits, I plan to update the schematics.

IRF7319.fzpz - this is a MOSFET HEXFET IRF7319

SRD-5VDC-SL-C.fzpz = this is a SONGLE relay
